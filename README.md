### About The Project

This project is a simplified version of building the ls command in node. "nls" command is defined in the bin of package.json that allows users to check what files and folders are in either the current working directory or the directory of the path inputed by the user in the terminal. All folders are printed to the console in red and all non folders are printed in yellow.

The purpose of the project was to create a simple command line tool with node and to practice using common node modules.
